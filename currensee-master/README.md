# Currensee

Currensee is an Android app built for quick identification and counting of currency notes. It was built at the inclusive STEM hackathon hosted at IIIT-Bangalore.

It is still WIP. We'll be working towards a Play Store release over the next few months.

Currently, it supports identification of only Indian Rupee notes.
