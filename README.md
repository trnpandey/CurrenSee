# CurrenSee
Currensee is an Android app built for quick identification and counting of currency notes. It was built at the inclusive STEM hackathon hosted at IIIT-Bangalore. Currently, it supports identification of only Indian Rupee notes. We have used Microsoft Custom Vision, Tensor flow models and Android app development for this project.
